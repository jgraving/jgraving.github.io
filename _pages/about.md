I am a Research Scientist at the [Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior](https://www.ab.mpg.de/) where I lead a central machine learning research group that focuses on developing advanced, general-purpose methods for the measurement and analysis of animal behavior in laboratory and field environments using computer vision, deep learning, and modern statistical methods. I work collaboratively with researchers across departments led by [Martin Wikelski](https://www.ab.mpg.de/wikelski), [Iain Couzin](https://www.ab.mpg.de/couzin), and [Meg Crofoot](https://www.ab.mpg.de/crofoot).
